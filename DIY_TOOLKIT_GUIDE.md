## Phone Negotiation Psychology

### The Power of Silence
After making your offer or hearing theirs, COUNT TO 10 slowly before responding.
- Most people crack at 3-4 seconds
- Managers often improve offers at 7-8 seconds
- Record holder: 23 seconds of silence = extra $3,000 off

### Voice Techniques
- **Lower your voice**: Authority and confidence
- **Slow your pace**: Control and thoughtfulness
- **Pause between points**: Let them absorb
- **Mirror their energy**: But stay calmer

### Psychological Triggers
1. **Anchoring**: Start with Medicare rates (low anchor)
2. **Urgency**: "I can pay today if we agree"
3. **Loss aversion**: "Otherwise I'll need to file complaints"
4. **Social proof**: "Other patients have told me..."
5. **Authority**: "My attorney advised..." (even if informal)

## Email/Letter Strategy

### Timing Matters
- **Monday morning**: Gets attention, starts their week
- **Thursday afternoon**: Pressure to clear before weekend
- **Never Friday**: Gets buried

### Subject Lines That Work
- "Settlement Offer - Account #12345 - Response Needed"
- "Time-Sensitive: Medical Bill Resolution"
- "Final Attempt Before Regulatory Action"

### Follow-Up Cadence
1. Initial email
2. Follow-up call (Day 3)
3. Second email with deadline (Day 7)
4. Escalation letter (Day 10)
5. Regulatory complaints (Day 15)
